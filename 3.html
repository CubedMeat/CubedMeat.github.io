     <h1>The Hubris of Man</h1>
     <hr>
     <p>Let this webpage stand as testimony to the hubris of man. I had set out with the idea of a database of cheese, of which one could easly find the exact cheese they desired based soley on visual characteristics. Oh how misguided I was. This was a daunting task, I knew going into it, but the sheer scale I had yet, and to this day do not comprehend the enormity of this task I set before myself. I was over confident. I was a fool. My hubris was my downfall.</p>
